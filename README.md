# OceanHackWeek Project 2022: Investigate Seismic Wave Speed From an Alaska Earthquake

Project Description: Choose one earthquake from the Alaska Earthquake Catalog to investigate how P- and S-waves from that earthquake travel through the earth as recorded by an ocean bottom seismometer network. These observations could provide us with insights in to what controls wave-speeds on earth. Scientifically try to draw conclusions from what the data presents (Eg:- Are these velocities azimuth-dependent? if so why would it have different P and S wave velocities in different directions)
Use the dataset of data from one earthquake and P and S wave arrival time of each station to produce a GIF/video of P- and S-wave arrivals across the seismometer network.
